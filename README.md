## Critter Chronologer System - RESTful API Project - Nanodegree, Java Web Developer (Udacity)

This project was developed with the aim of creating a comprehensive backend system for a service management platform, focusing on managing customers, employees, and pets. Inspired by real-world service management systems, the project covers everything from basic CRUD (⁠`Create` ⁠, ⁠`Read`⁠, ⁠`Update`, and `⁠Delete`⁠) operations to integrations with external APIs for ⁠ enhanced functionality ⁠, such as ⁠ authentication ⁠, ⁠ authorization ⁠, and ⁠ scheduling services ⁠.

This project aims to develop a RESTful API to manage operations for a pet care service, including customer, pet, employee, and scheduling management. The system is designed to facilitate efficient scheduling of services based on employee availability and skills, ensuring seamless operation of pet care services.  The scope of the project based on the provided code is focused on:

**Customer Management:** Registering and retrieving customer information.

**Pet Management:** Adding, viewing, updating, and managing pet data.

**Employee Management:** Managing employee data, including setting availability and retrieving employees for specific services.

**Scheduling Services:** Scheduling services based on employee availability and skills.
